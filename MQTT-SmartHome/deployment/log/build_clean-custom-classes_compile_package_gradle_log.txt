> Task :clean-custom-classes
Caching disabled for task ':clean-custom-classes' because:
  Build cache is disabled
Task ':clean-custom-classes' is not up-to-date because:
  Task has not declared any outputs despite executing actions.
Resolve mutations for :compile (Thread[Execution worker Thread 2,5,main]) started.
:compile (Thread[Execution worker Thread 3,5,main]) started.

> Task :compile
Caching disabled for task ':compile' because:
  Build cache is disabled
Task ':compile' is not up-to-date because:
  Value of input property 'options.release' has changed for task ':compile'
The input changes require a full rebuild for incremental task ':compile'.
Full recompilation is required because no incremental change information is available. This is usually caused by clean builds or changing compiler arguments.
Compiling with toolchain 'C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-11.0.20.8-hotspot'.
Compiling with JDK Java compiler API.
